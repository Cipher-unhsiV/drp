            <p>This project focuses on detecting GAP UP and GAP DOWN patterns in candlestick charts, which are widely used in technical analysis for stock market trading. Using a YOLOv11l (You Only Look Once) object detection model, the project identifies these patterns in candlestick chart images. </p>

            <p>It is designed to help traders and analysts quickly identify GAP patterns, saving time and improving accuracy in technical analysis. The model is trained on a custom dataset and can be used to analyze charts for potential market movements. It includes a Gradio-based web interface for easy interaction and real-time detection.</p>
