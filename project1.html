                <li><a href="https://github.com/Cipher-unhsiV/gap-pattern-detection" target="_blank">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Developed an advanced pattern detection system for candlestick charts, leveraging YOLOv11l to identify GAP UP and GAP DOWN formations in stock market trading. The model enables rapid recognition of critical technical analysis patterns, assisting traders in making informed decisions. By employing a deep learning approach, the system enhances pattern detection accuracy and trading efficiency.</p>

            <p>Designed and trained the YOLOv11l model on a custom dataset of candlestick chart images, optimizing it for high precision in real-world financial market scenarios. The dataset was meticulously curated to ensure robust detection across various market conditions. Implemented a structured data augmentation pipeline to enhance generalization and minimize false detections in volatile trading environments.</p>
            
            <p>To ensure seamless usability, integrated a Gradio-based web interface, facilitating real-time interaction with the detection system. The interface enables traders to upload chart images and instantly obtain pattern predictions, making technical analysis more accessible. The web-based deployment allows for easy integration with existing trading platforms, providing a scalable solution for market analysts.</p>

            <p>By combining deep learning, financial market expertise, and an intuitive user interface, this project streamlines pattern recognition in technical analysis. It empowers traders with actionable insights, reducing manual effort in identifying crucial candlestick formations and significantly improving the efficiency of stock market predictions.</p>
