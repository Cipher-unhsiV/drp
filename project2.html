            </ul>
            <p>Developed a Fintech PDF Summarizer to enhance accessibility of complex financial documents by generating concise, layman-friendly summaries. The system streamlines financial reporting by converting intricate regulatory filings, earnings reports, and investment documents into easily digestible insights. This solution caters to both industry professionals and the general public, reducing information overload in financial decision-making.</p>

            <p>Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing LangChain and LlamaIndex as the integration framework for various Large Language Models (LLMs). The architecture leverages ChromaDB as a vector database to enable efficient document retrieval and structured data summarization. This approach ensures high contextual accuracy while maintaining the integrity of financial information.</p>

            <p>Explored and incorporated advanced AI frameworks such as Agno AGI (Phidata) and Langflow to enhance customization capabilities. By integrating multiple AI Agents, vector databases, and LLMs, the system enables tailored PDF generation with optimized financial summaries. This modular design allows for seamless adaptation across different financial analysis use cases, from investment research to corporate reporting.</p>

            <p>By combining AI-driven summarization techniques with cutting-edge financial technology, this project significantly improves the accessibility of financial data. The system empowers users with actionable insights, reduces manual effort in document analysis, and enhances transparency in financial communications.</p>
